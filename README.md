## Exercise 3.9: DBaaS vs DIY
- **Managed Database (DBaaS):** Pros include automated backups [cite: 80], high availability, and minimal maintenance[cite: 79]. The main con is the higher cost compared to self-hosted solutions[cite: 79].
- **Self-hosted Database (DIY):** Pros are full control over configuration and lower costs[cite: 79]. Cons include the need for manual setup of backup systems (see exercise 3.10) and significant maintenance effort[cite: 79, 83].
