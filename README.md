## Exercise 3.9: DBaaS vs DIY
A comparison of managed database services (DBaaS) versus hosting your own database in a container (DIY)[cite: 78]:

- **DBaaS (e.g., Google Cloud SQL):**
  - **Pros:** Automated backups, high availability, and significantly less maintenance work[cite: 79, 80].
  - **Cons:** Higher monthly costs[cite: 79].
- **DIY (Postgres in a Container):**
  - **Pros:** Full control over configuration and lower costs using cluster resources[cite: 78, 79].
  - **Cons:** Requires manual setup for backups (see exercise 3.10) and more maintenance effort[cite: 80, 83].
